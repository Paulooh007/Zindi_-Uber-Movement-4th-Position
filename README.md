The objective of this challenge is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts when and where the next road incident will occur in Cape Town, South Africa. This  model was built using historic road incident data as well as traffic pattern data from Uber.

The resulting model will enable South African authorities to anticipate where they will be needed next and to put measures in place that will help ensure the safety of all Cape Townâ€™s residents.

## Solution
The data was trained using Light Gradient Boost and CatBoost Model. The final prediction is an average of the two models.
